to create a python virtual environment

proj-directory> python -m pip install virtualenv
proj-directory> python -m venv flask

it creates an virtual environment named flask.

to open that environment:

proj-directory> .\\flask\Scripts\activate
upon successful activation, it shows like this

(flask)proj-directory>

now install flask by typing

(flask)proj-directory> pip install flask

to close your virtual environment type 

(flask)proj-directory> deactivate

it terminates your virtual environment and that (flask) part is now gone
